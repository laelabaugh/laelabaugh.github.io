## About Me

Hello, and welcome to my data portfolio! My name is Laela and I am a growing business analyst documenting her learning journey in data and tech. My current toolkit includes **SQL** and **Power BI**, with **Python** currently on the roadmap. My learning and progress has been self-taught thus far, but I look forward to starting my master’s degree and the benefit to come from learning from seasoned professionals alongside fellow passionate peers.

My projects reflect a strong competence in defining metrics, translating business problems into clear narratives, and converting complex data into actionable insights.
