My current toolkit includes **SQL** and **Power BI**, and I am currently building on my **Python** skills. My learning and progress has been self-taught thus far, but I look forward to starting my master’s degree and the benefit to come from learning from seasoned professionals alongside fellow passionate peers.

My projects reflect a strong competence in defining metrics, translating business problems into clear questions for exploration, and converting complex data into actionable insights.
